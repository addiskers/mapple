      <p>

  <h2 itemprop="name">How much money can I borrow?</h2>

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        Credit Loan Canada's lending partners offer loans that range from $100-$15,000. The loan amount you qualify for can depend on which lender approves you, your credit profile, your net income and what province you live in.

<div id="faq-1-3" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
  <h2 itemprop="name">What interest rate can I expect?</h2>

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        Rates and terms may vary by province and by lender. If we are successful in finding you loan offers, once you are connected with a lender, you will get the APR and fees applicable to you. All loans are subject to the lender's approval based on their own unique underwriting criteria.

  <h2 itemprop="name">What are the requirements to get a loan?</h2>

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        To be approved for a loan, you need to meet the individual requirements of the lender you are connected to. The lender will evaluate your information and decide if you are eligible based on its own established list of considerations such as income, past loan history and state of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you click on one of your loan offers, your chosen lender may ask for extra information in order to approve your loan. For the best chance of receiving loan offers, make sure you fill out the form with truthful and accurate information.

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        Yes! We know that many Canadians face challenges in qualifying for loans and other services due to their credit score. However that does not mean no solutions exist. In fact, our platform helps Canadians to qualify for any loan regardless of their credit score based on our Lender's criteria.

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        No. If you apply for a service using our website, we only collect the minimum amount required for you to qualify with a provider but at no point does Credit Loan Canada check your credit score.

<div id="faq-1-7" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
  <h2 itemprop="name">Will I be prequalified if I have bad credit?</h2>

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        Credit Loan Canada has partnerships with numerous loan lending partners to ensure we can offer loans and financial products to as many customers as possible. Some of the lenders we work with offer bad credit personal loans. The final decision always comes down to the lender, so while we cannot guarantee you will get a loan, we will always do our best to find suitable loan offers for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, since our search does not affect your credit score, it is completely free of charge and no-obligation, you can give it a try and see if you have any loan offers available.

  <h2 itemprop="name">How much will my loan cost?</h2>

  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <div itemscope itemprop="text">
      <p>
        Your lender determines the cost of your loan. The lender also sets the fees and interest associated with your loan. This information appears in your loan agreement. We recommend reading through your loan agreement carefully before you sign it.
